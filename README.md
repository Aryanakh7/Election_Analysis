### Conclusion 

The analysis above provides an overview which will help Seth and Tom by facilitating the submission of the election audit results to the election commission.
This script can be integrated to any electoral process in order to determine different components of an election, such as: candidate name, candidate number and participation, county name, county participation, number of votes, district and national elements, volunteer involvement, parties represented, municipality participation, voting by anticipation, number of voting polls, winning candidates and percentages. 
This script provides a decomposable and understandable way to assemble different elements of an election, by providing a precise and concise analysis of an electoral dataset. It can be modified to include the number of voting polls and volunteers, as well as the official parties and states represented by the candidates.
